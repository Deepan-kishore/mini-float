**Project Task Scheduling and Team Management App**

This project is inspired by Float.com and was developed as part of my application for a Software Developer position at Float.

I used a cloned version of a React Scheduler library for the calendar and incorporated features similar to those in Float, such as:

- Creating allocations by clicking on a date
- Viewing allocations
- Editing existing allocations
- Managing teams
- Adding and editing team member details
- Automatic calendar updates when team member details are changed
  
If you encounter any issues while running the app after cloning it, feel free to reach out, and Iâ€™ll be happy to assist.
